   * battery voltage"
   * @param child_object_id optional child identifier for this entity in case there are several sensors of the same
   * entity type for the same node ID. Example: If you have a lock for the node ID "door", the home asisstant
   * configuration path will be "homeassistant/binary_sensor/door/lock/config". This works if you only have one lock on
   * your door, but if you have two locks, you want to add a child object ID to them. By setting the child_object_id to
   * say "upper", the configuration will be "homeassistant/binary_sensor/door/lock/upper/config". This also apply for
   * all state/command topics and so on. Leave as empty string for no child object ID.
   * @param force_update In Home Assistant, trigger events even if the sensor's state hasn't changed. Useful if you want
   * to have meaningful value graphs in history or want to create an automation that triggers on every incoming state
   * message (not only when the sensorâ€™s new state is different to the current one).
   * @param unit the unit of measurement reported for this sensor. Make sure that the value you publish is of this unit.
